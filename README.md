This project was build for the course <i>Internet Applications Development</i> on Czech Technical University in Prague.
<br/>
The application uses three different apis.<br/> First one is made by me, which provides data about slovak
rap artists. It's available in the top menu under "api". 
<br/>
Second one is <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">Spotify Api</a> 
(top menu under "player") - You can choose to connect your spotify account with this app, then you will get randomly 
chosen song from the slovak rap artist - Pil C. Just to note, some songs are explicit :) If you cancel connecting with 
your account, or if you press button "I do not have an account", you'll get a default song <b>Hawaii</b>.
<br/>
The last one uses <a href="https://kanye.rest">Kanye.Rest</a>. Accessible at "kanye", it obtains some quote of 
Kanye West, some of which are also explicit :).

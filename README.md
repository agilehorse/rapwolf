This project was build for the course <i>Internet Applications Development</i> on Czech Technical University in Prague.
<br/>
The application uses three different apis.<br/> First one is made by me (top menu under "api"), which provides data about 
slovak rap artists. It's available in the top menu under "api". It's public, except for endpoints that modify data, more 
info <a href="http://rapwolf.herokuapp.com/api-docs">here</a>.
<br/>
Second one is <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api"> Spotify Api </a> available 
at "player" - You can choose to connect your spotify account with this app, then you will get randomly chosen song from 
the slovak rap artist - Pil C. Just to note, some songs are explicit :) If you cancel connecting with your account, or 
if you press button "I do not have an account", you'll get a default song Hawaii. 
<br/>
The last one uses <a href="https://kanye.rest">Kanye.Rest</a>. Accessible at "kanye", it obtains some quote of Kanye West,
some of which are also explicit :).
